## 📝 Module Summary and Key Takeaways

This module focused on developing a server-side application using **Express.js**, which significantly simplified tasks that would be difficult to implement using raw **Node.js**.

### Express.js and Setup
* We successfully created an Express application, demonstrating how it provides essential, ready-made features like a **body parser**. This allowed us to initialize the application and manage middleware with minimal code.
* We easily installed and configured **dotenv** for managing environment variables.

### API Development
We developed a complete set of fundamental **RESTful API** endpoints:
* `POST` (Create a new resource)
* `GET` (Retrieve all resources)
* `GET` single item by `id` (Retrieve a specific resource)
* `DELETE` (Remove a resource)
* We also implemented a **404 Not Found** route to handle requests to non-existent paths.
* A custom **logger middleware** was created to observe and record incoming requests.

### Database Focus (PostgreSQL)
* We covered the very basics of **PostgreSQL**, focusing on the essential queries needed for current operations. These fundamental queries are sufficient for the immediate needs of this Module.
* **Current Priority:** Our primary focus is on developing and refining these APIs.
* **Next Steps:** After completing the APIs and learning the **Module Pattern**, we will delve into **PostgreSQL** in greater depth.
